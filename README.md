We all might agree that Atomic CSS is a helpful tool for both FE and BE development. There's a lot of Atomic CSS 
frameworks out there (like [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)), however, to **elevate the advantage of Atomic CSS**, while keeping
it in **as light-weight as possible**, and even **customizable** for each project, we have this project on the go.
