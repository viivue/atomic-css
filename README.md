We all might agree that Atomic CSS is a helpful tool for both FE and BE development. There's a lot of Atomic CSS 
frameworks out there (like [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)), however, to **elevate the advantage of Atomic CSS**, while keeping
it in **as light-weight as possible**, and even **customizable** for each project, we have this project on the go.

## Usage

Install NPM package with basic config

```shell
npm i @viivue/atomic-css
```

Import

```js
import "@viivue/atomic-css";
```

Or, you can download the default Atomic CSS files in the [`/dist` folder](https://github.com/viivue/atomic-css/tree/main/dist).

### Customization

To add custom classes for a specific project, you will have to:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Edit the `/scss/_config.scss`, you will find some example templates there.
3. Generate the new Atomic CSS by `npm run prod`.

## Deployment

```shell
npm install

# Watch SCSS files, then compile to previewed CSS
npm run dev

# Compile compressed CSS for distribution.
# Check version at `_defs.scss` and `package.json`
npm run prod

# Publish NPM package
# Auto-publish package on release using GitHub workflow
npm publish
```
